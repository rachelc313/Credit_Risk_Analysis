# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Loan Prediction Risk Analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to create six supervised machine learning models to determine which model would be best to use. The machine learning models that were created were:

- Naive Oversampling Model
- SMOTE Oversampling Model
- Undersampling Model
- SMOTEEN Algorithm
- BalancedRandomForestClassifier Algorithm
- EasyEnsembleClassifier Algorithm

## Results
The results of this analysis are as follows:
